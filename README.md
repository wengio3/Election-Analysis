# Election-Audit Summary:


This analysis was created using Python, making it reusable for similar tasks that need to be performed in the future. We can do this in a few different ways; here are two good examples: 

1.Defining a Function 
A function is a  block of reusable codes. The keyword for a function block is def, followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ). for more information on the defining function, here is a future reading https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm


2. Change the .csv file its linked to 
Since we are using the .csv files to import the data we used for this analysis, using a different .csv file and making a few modifications to our code, we can reuse the code to analyze other election results.
